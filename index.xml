      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I have contemplated starting a blog. At the start of every year this thought occurs to me and every year I have shelved this idea with the same reason : Who cares what I have to say? Though to be fully self-critical, procrastination is also an equal conspirator here.
However, I have realized in recent times that writing isn&amp;rsquo;t only to express your thoughts to others, it is also powerful tool to express your thoughts with clarity to yourself.</description>
